# node_boiler_minimal
a nodeJS boilerplate with Express, EJS, Bower, Milligram CSS Framework and Gulp with SCSS pre-processor 


###To use:

* Clone this repo to your local device
* Run `npm i` in the directory of the cloned repo. This will install the node dependencies.
* Run `nodemon` or `npm start` to run the node app. 
* Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the boilerplate
* In a new terminal window in the boilerplate root directory run `gulp`. This starts Gulp which compiles our SCSS to CSS.
* NB. Any changes to CSS should be made in the SCSS files in Public folder.
